# Football-Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-PostgreSQL-Power-BI-and-Machine-Learning
“Football Data Analysis and Prediction Project”, focuses on analyzing and predicting football performance using real-world data and modern data analytics tools.

We collected raw football datasets from Kaggle, containing detailed information about players, clubs, matches, competitions, and transfers. After cleaning and organizing the data, we designed a relational database using PostgreSQL, where multiple interrelated tables were created to store structured data efficiently.

Using this database, we performed 21 analytical SQL queries to extract meaningful insights — such as player performance trends, club efficiency, transfer market behavior, and competition analysis. Each query generated a result table representing a specific insight.

After completing the database analysis, all 21 result tables were imported into Power BI to create an interactive data visualization dashboard. This dashboard visually represents patterns and statistics, making the findings more understandable and insightful.

Finally, as an extension of the project, we developed a machine learning classification model using Python. The model predicts whether a player’s future performance will be good or bad based on their past statistics such as goals, assists, matches, and appearances.

Through this project, we demonstrated the full life cycle of data analysis — from data collection and storage to querying, visualization, and predictive modeling — showing how data-driven insights can be applied effectively in the world of football analytics.
